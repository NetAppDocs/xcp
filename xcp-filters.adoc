XCP provides filter options that can be used in XCP operations.

XCP uses filters for `-match` and `-exclude` options for NFS and SMB.

For NFS, run `xcp help info` and refer to the FILTERS section to see how to use `-match` and `-exclude` filters.

For SMB, run `xcp help -match` and `xcp help -exclude` to get more details on `match` and `exclude` filters.

If you want to use filters in XCP commands, run `xcp help <command>` to see if they are supported options.
