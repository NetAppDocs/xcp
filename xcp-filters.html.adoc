XCP provides filter options that can be used in XCP operations. XCP uses filters for `-match` and `-exclude` (NFS only) options.

For NFS, run `xcp help info` and refer to the FILTERS section to see how to use `-match` and `-exclude` filters.

For SMB, run `xcp help -match` to get more details on match (`-exclude` is not available in SMB).

If you want to use filters in XCP commands, run `xcp help <command>` to see if they are supported options.
