|===
|XCP issue | Solution

|`xcp: ERROR`: must run as root
|Execute XCP commands as root user
|`xcp: ERROR`: License file `/opt/NetApp/xFiles/xcp/license` not found.
|Download the license from https://xcp.netapp.com and copy to `/opt/NetApp/xFiles/xcp/`
|`xcp: ERROR`: This license has expired
|Renew or obtain the new XCP license from http://xcp.netapp.com.
|`xcp: ERROR`: License unreadable
|License file might be corrupted. Obtain the new XCP license from http://xcp.netapp.com.
|`xcp: ERROR`: XCP not activated,
run 'activate' first
|Run the `xcp activate` command
|This copy is not licensed
|Obtain the appropriate XCP license file. Copy the XCP license to the `/opt/NetApp/xFiles/xcp/` directory on the XCP server. Run the `xcp activate` command to activate the license.
|`xcp: ERROR`: Failed to activate license: Server unreachable
|You are trying to activate the online license and your host system is not connected to internet. Make sure your system is connected internet.
|`xcp: ERROR`: Failed to activate license: Server xcp.netapp.com unreachable
`xcp: HINT`: Configure DNS on this host or return to the license page to request a private license
Expected error: Failed to activate license: Server xcp.netapp.com unreachable
|Make sure xcp.netapp.com is reachable from your host or request for the offline license
|`xcp: ERROR`: Catalog inaccessible: Cannot mount `nfs_server:/export[:subdirectory]`
|Open the editor on the XCP Linux client host and update the configuration file with the proper catalog location. The XCP configuration file is located at `/opt/NetApp/xFiles/xcp/xcp.ini`. Sample entries of configuration file:

`[root@scspr1949387001 ~]# cat /opt/NetApp/xFiles/xcp/xcp.ini # Sample xcp config [xcp] catalog = 10.235.128.153:/catalog`
|`nfs3 error 2`: no such file or directory
|Operation did not find the source file(s) on the target NFS export. Run the `xcp sync` command to copy the incremental updates from source to destination
|`xcp: ERROR`: Empty or invalid index
|Previous copy operation was interrupted before indexing the files. Rerun `xcp copy` with the new index and make sure the system returns “indexed” before interrupting copy
|`xcp: ERROR`: compare batches: child process failed (`exit code -9): recv <type 'exceptions.EOFError'>`
|Follow the instructions in the following KB article: link:https://kb.netapp.com/Advice_and_Troubleshooting/Data_Storage_Software/NetApp_XCP/XCP:_ERROR:_Cannot_allocate_memory_-_when_syncing_NFS_data[Cannot allocate memory when synching NFS data]
|`xcp: ERROR`: For xcp to process ACLs, please mount `<path>` using the OS nfs4 client
|Mount the source/target on the XCP host
