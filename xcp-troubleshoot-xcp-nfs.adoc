== XCP issues and solutions

|===
|XCP issue | Solution

|`xcp: ERROR`: must run as root
|Execute XCP commands as root user
|`xcp: ERROR`: License file `/opt/NetApp/xFiles/xcp/license` not found.
|Download the license from the link:https://xcp.netapp.com/[XCP site^], copy it to `/opt/NetApp/xFiles/xcp/`, and activate it by running the `xcp activate` command.
|`xcp: ERROR`: This license has expired
|Renew or obtain the new XCP license from the link:https://xcp.netapp.com/[XCP site^].
|`xcp: ERROR`: License unreadable
|License file might be corrupted. Obtain the new XCP license from the link:https://xcp.netapp.com/[XCP site^].
|`xcp: ERROR`: XCP not activated,
run 'activate' first
|Run the `xcp activate` command
|This copy is not licensed
|Obtain the appropriate XCP license file. Copy the XCP license to the `/opt/NetApp/xFiles/xcp/` directory on the XCP server. Run the `xcp activate` command to activate the license.
|`xcp: ERROR`: Failed to activate license: Server unreachable
|You are trying to activate the online license and your host system is not connected to the internet. Make sure your system is connected to the internet.
|`xcp: ERROR`: Failed to activate license: Server xcp.netapp.com unreachable
`xcp: HINT`: Configure DNS on this host or return to the license page to request a private license
Expected error: Failed to activate license: Server xcp.netapp.com unreachable
|Make sure xcp.netapp.com is reachable from your host or request for the offline license
|`xcp: ERROR`: Catalog inaccessible: Cannot mount `nfs_server:/export[:subdirectory]`
|Open the editor on the XCP Linux client host and update the configuration file with the proper catalog location. The XCP configuration file is located at `/opt/NetApp/xFiles/xcp/xcp.ini`. Sample entries of configuration file:

`[root@scspr1949387001 ~]# cat /opt/NetApp/xFiles/xcp/xcp.ini`
`[xcp]`
`catalog = 10.235.128.153:/catalog`
|`nfs3 error 2`: no such file or directory
|Operation did not find the source file(s) on the target NFS export. Run the `xcp sync` command to copy the incremental updates from source to destination
|`xcp: ERROR`: Empty or invalid index
|Previous copy operation was interrupted before the index file was created. Rerun the same command with the new index and when the command is executing, verify that the keyword “indexed” is displayed in the stats.
|`xcp: ERROR`: compare batches: child process failed `(exit code -9): recv <type 'exceptions.EOFError'>`
|Follow the instructions in the following KB article: link:https://kb.netapp.com/Advice_and_Troubleshooting/Data_Storage_Software/NetApp_XCP/XCP:_ERROR:_Cannot_allocate_memory_-_when_syncing_NFS_data[Cannot allocate memory when synching NFS data^]
|`xcp: ERROR`: For xcp to process ACLs, please mount `<path>` using the OS nfs4 client
|Mount the source and target on the XCP host using NFSv4, for example, `mount -o vers=4.0 10.10.10.10:/source_vol /mnt/source`

|The XCP `verify` command fails during a migration.
The STATUS shows as FAILED. (Live)
|The XCP `verify` command was run when the source was live. Run the XCP `verify` command after the final cutover.

|The XCP `verify` command fails after a cutover. (Live)
|The XCP cutover sync operation might not have copied all the data. Rerun the XCP `sync` command followed by the `verify` command after the final cutover. If the problem persists, contact technical support.

|The XCP `sync` command fails (this applies to all sync failures during migrations). (Live)
|XCP is not able to read the data, this might be due to an XCP issue. Check the XCP STATUS message after the command operation completes.
Rerun the `sync` command. If the sync operation fails again, contact technical support.

|The XCP `copy`, `resume`, and `sync` commands fail due to insufficient memory.
XCP crashes and the XCP status shows as FAILED. (Live)
|There is low available memory on the host or there has been a huge incremental change. Follow the instructions in the following KB article: link:https://kb.netapp.com/Advice_and_Troubleshooting/Data_Storage_Software/NetApp_XCP/XCP:_ERROR:_Cannot_allocate_memory_-_when_syncing_NFS_data[Cannot allocate memory when synching NFS data^]
|`mnt3 error 13: permission denied`
|As a non-root user, you do not have the correct permissions to access the file system. Check if you can access the file system and perform read write operations.
|`xcp: batch 1: ERROR: [Errno 13] Permission denied:`
|As a non-root user, you do not have the correct permissions to access the file system. Check if you can access the file system and perform read write operations.
|`mxcp: ERROR: OSMounter 'file:///t/ 10.234.115.215_src_vol/DIR': [Errno 2] No such file or directory`
|The path `/t/10.234.115.215_src_vol/ DIR` is not mounted on the Linux file system. Check if the path exists.
|`ERROR: run sync {-id: 'xcp_index_1624263869.3734858'}: sync not yet available for hdfs/ posix/s3fs sources and targets -workaround is copy with a match filter for recent mods`
|The `sync` command is not supported in XCP for the POSIX and HDFS connectors.
|The `xcp verify` command fails with different mod time
|You can identify the file and manually copy the file to the destination.
|`Non dir object copy/sync can not be resumed; try copy again.`
`For more details please refer XCP user guide.`
|Because you cannot resume a single file, it is recommended to run the `xcp copy` command again for the file.
Any change in the file leads to a complete copy of the file. As a result, performance is not affected.
|`Non dir object can not be synced; try copy again.`
`For more details please refer XCP user guide.`
|Because you cannot sync a single file, it is recommended to run the `xcp copy` command again for the file.
Any change in the file leads to a complete copy of the file. As a result, performance is not affected.
|`xcp: ERROR: batch 4: Could not connect to node:`
|Verify that the node given in the `—nodes` parameter is reachable. Try connecting by using Secure Shell (SSH) from the master node
|`[Error 13] permission denied`
|Check if you have permission to write on the destination volume.
|`xcp: ERROR: batch 2: child process failed (exit code -6): recv <type 'exceptions.EOFError'>:`
|Increase your system memory and rerun the test.

== Logdump

If you encounter an issue with an XCP command or job, the `logdump` command enables you dump log files related to the issue into a zipped folder that can be sent to NetApp for debugging. The `logdump` command filters logs based on the migration ID or job ID and dumps those logs into a folder and a zipped folder in the current directory. The directory and zipped folder has the same name as the migration or job ID that is used with the command.

*Example*
----
xcp logdump -j <job id>
xcp logdump -m <migration id>
----

NOTE: After migration, if you use the `XCP_CONFIG_DIR` or `XCP_LOG_DIR` environment variables to override the default config location or log location, the `logdump` command fails when used with an old migration or job ID. To avoid this, use the same logpath until migration completes.
