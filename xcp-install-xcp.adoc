== Install and configure workflow

This document provides an easy workflow for installing and setting up XCP on NFS and SMB systems.

== Download XCP

Download XCP from the NetApp support site and obtain a license from the XCP site.

You can download XCP from the link:https://mysupport.netapp.com/products/p/xcp.html[NetApp Support site].

== License XCP

NetApp offers a free 90-day XCP license. You can obtain the license file from https://xcp.netapp.com. The licensing portal offers different licensing options. After 90 days you can renew the license for another 90 days using the same portal.

The XCP license is available as an offline or online license. If you want to send migration statistics use an online license. The online license requires an internet connection. The offline license does not require an internet connection.

== Prepare your system

If you are using XCP NFS on a Linux system, you must prepare catalog and storage.

If you are using XCP SMB on a Microsoft Windows system, you must prepare storage.

== Prepare Linux for XCP NFS
XCP NFS uses Linux client host systems to generate parallel I/O streams and fully use available network and storage performance.

=== Configure catalog
XCP saves operation reports and metadata in an NFSv3-accessible catalog directory. Provisioning the catalog is a one-time preinstallation task requiring the following:

*	A NetApp NFSv3 export for security and reliability.
*	At least ten disks or solid-state drives in the aggregate containing the export for performance.
*	Storage configured to allow root access to the catalog export for the IP addresses of all Linux clients used to run XCP (multiple XCP clients can share a catalog location).
*	Approximately 1 GB of space for every 10 million objects (directories plus files and hard links) to be indexed; each copy that can be resumed or synched and each offline-searchable scan requires an index.

NOTE: You should store XCP catalogs separately. They should not be located on either the source or destination NFS export directory. XCP maintains metadataâ€”reports in the catalog location specified during the initial setup. You must specify and update the location for storing the reports before you run any operation with XCP.

=== Configure storage

XCP NFS transitions and migrations have the following source and target storage requirements:

*	Source and target servers must have NFSv3 protocol service enabled. For NFSv4 ACL migration, you must enable NFSv4 protocol service and NFSv4 ACL on the destination server.
*	Source and target volumes must be exported with root access to the XCP Linux client host.

NOTE: Configure the source for NFSv3 and NFSv4 exports as read-only so administrators cannot accidentally modify it.
