File Analytics provides a graphical view of scan results.

XCP File Analytics GUI provides a dashboard with graphs for visualizing File Analytics.
The XCP File Analytics GUI is enabled when you configure XCP on a Linux machine.

NOTE: To check the supported browsers for accessing File Analytics, see the link:https://mysupport.netapp.com/matrix/[NetApp IMT^].

.Steps

. Use the link `\https://<IP address of linux machine>/xcp` to access the File Analytics GUI.
When prompted, accept the security certificate:
.. Select Advanced below the privacy statement.
..	Select the proceed to `<IP address of linux machine>` link.
. Log in to the File Analytics GUI
+
There are two ways to log in to the File Analytics GUI.
+
.. By using the username “admin” and the password you set during configuration.
+

+
.. Configure and enable enterprise-wide single sign on capability to log in.
+
You can use this login capability to setup XCP File Analytics on a particular machine and share the web UI URL enterprise-wide. You can use this to login to the File Analytics UI using your enterprise SSO credentials. 
+
NOTE: SSO login is optional and can be configured and enabled permanently. 
To setup SAML based SSO login, refer to the  <<Configure SSO credentials>> section.

. On login, you can see that the NFS agent is added: a green tick is present showing minimal system configuration of the Linux system and XCP version.
.	If you have configured an SMB agent, you can see the SMB agent added in the same agent card.

== Configure SSO credentials

The SSO (single sign-on) based login mechanism is implemented in XCP File Analytics using SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) and supported with the Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS) identity provider. SAML offloads the task of authentication to the enterprise's third-party Identity Provider (IdP) that can utilize any number of approaches for MFA (multifactor authentication). 

.Steps

. Register the XCP File Analytics application with your enterprise identity provider.
+
File Analytics now runs as a service provider (SP) and therefore must be registered with your enterprise identity provider. Generally, there is a team in the enterprise that handles this SSO integration process. The first step is to find and reach out to the relevant team and share the metadata details for your your File Analytics application with them.
+
The following are the mandatory details that you must share to register with your identity provider: 
+
* *SP Entity id* - `https://<IP address of linux machine>/xcp`
* *SP Assertion consumer Service URL (ACS)* - `https://<IP address of linux machine>:5030/api/xcp/SAML/sp`
+
You can also verify these details by logging in to the File Analytics UI:
+
.. Login to UI using the username “admin” and password set up during installation.
+
.. Select the *User* icon on the top right corner of the page, then select *SAML settings*. 
+
Check *Service provider settings* in the drop down menu that appears.
+
*Example*

+
After registration, you receive details of your enterprise's IdP endpoints. You are required to provide this IdP endpoint metadata to the File Analytics UI. 

. Provide the Identity provider (IdP) details:
.. Go to *Dashboard*, select the *User* icon at the top right corner of the page, then select *SAML settings*.
+
... Input the IdP details that you obtained after registration.
+
*Example*
+

+
.. Click the *Enable SAML* checkbox to permanently enable SAML-based SSO.
.. Click *Save*.
.. Log out of File Analytics and log back in again. You are redirected to your enterprise SSO page.
