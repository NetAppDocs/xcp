XCP NFS uses Linux client host systems to generate parallel I/O streams and fully use available network and storage performance.

=== Configure catalog
XCP saves operation reports and metadata in an NFSv3-accessible catalog directory. Provisioning the catalog is a one-time preinstallation task requiring the following:

*	A NetApp NFSv3 export for security and reliability.
*	At least ten disks or solid-state drives in the aggregate containing the export for performance.
*	Storage configured to allow root access to the catalog export for the IP addresses of all Linux clients used to run XCP (multiple XCP clients can share a catalog location).
*	Approximately 1 GB of space for every 10 million objects (directories plus files and hard links) to be indexed; each copy that can be resumed or synched and each offline-searchable scan requires an index.

NOTE: You should store XCP catalogs separately. They should not be located on either the source or destination NFS export directory. XCP maintains metadataâ€”reports in the catalog location specified during the initial setup. You must specify and update the location for storing the reports before you run any operation with XCP.

=== Configure storage

XCP NFS transitions and migrations have the following source and target storage requirements:

*	Source and target servers must have NFSv3 protocol service enabled. For NFSv4 ACL migration, you must enable NFSv4 protocol service and NFSv4 ACL on the destination server.
*	Source and target volumes must be exported with root access to the XCP Linux client host.

NOTE: Configure the source for NFSv3 and NFSv4 exports as read-only so administrators cannot accidentally modify it.
